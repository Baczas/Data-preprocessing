### pre_cleaner.py - Pre cleaning data (by column)

the pre_cleaner() function visualizes the data from a given column and then asks what to do with the column:
- d: drop column
- s: skip (correct later manually)
- f: fill with most_frequent value
- me: filled with mean value
- oh: One Hot encoding
- bin: Binary encoding

("bin" and "oh" not implemented yet)
